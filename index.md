		-  1. "FairRec: Two-Sided Fairness for Personalized Recommendations in Two-Sided Platforms": We investigate the problem of fair recommendation in the context of two-sided online platforms, comprising customers on one side and producers on the other. Traditionally, recommendation services in these platforms have focused on maximizing customer satisfaction by tailoring the results according to the personalized preferences of individual customers. However, our investigation reveals that such customer-centric design may lead to unfair distribution of exposure among the producers, which may adversely impact their well-being. On the other hand, a producer-centric design might become unfair to the customers. Thus, we consider fairness issues that span both customers and producers. Our approach involves a novel mapping of the fair recommendation problem to a constrained version of the problem of fairly allocating indivisible goods. Our proposed FairRec algorithm guarantees at least Maximin Share (MMS) of exposure for most of the producers and Envy-Free up to One item (EF1) fairness for every customer. Extensive evaluations over multiple real-world datasets show the effectiveness of FairRec in ensuring two-sided fairness while incurring a marginal loss in the overall recommendation quality. 


		-  2. "Incremental Fairness in Two-Sided Market Platforms: On Smoothly Updating Recommendations": Major online platforms today can be thought of as two-sided markets with producers and customers of goods and services. There have been concerns that over-emphasis on customer satisfaction by the platforms may affect the well-being of the producers. To counter such issues, few recent works have attempted to incorporate fairness for the producers. However, these studies have overlooked an important issue in such platforms -- to supposedly improve customer utility, the underlying algorithms are frequently updated, causing abrupt changes in the exposure of producers. In this work, we focus on the fairness issues arising out of such frequent updates, and argue for incremental updates of the platform algorithms so that the producers have enough time to adjust (both logistically and mentally) to the change. However, naive incremental updates may become unfair to the customers. Thus focusing on recommendations deployed on two-sided platforms, we formulate an ILP based online optimization to deploy changes incrementally in n steps, where we can ensure smooth transition of the exposure of items while guaranteeing a minimum utility for every customer. Evaluations over multiple real world datasets show that our proposed mechanism for platform updates can be efficient and fair to both the producers and the customers in two-sided platforms. 


		-  3. Two-Sided Guarantees in Search: Conventional IR systems use several state-of-the-art methods to find out the relevance of an item (doc, webpage, etc.) to a search query. However in two-sided platforms like Amazon, Yelp, Booking.com etc. where there are producers of goods and services, and customers who pay for them, the idea of personalised relevance of products/producers to search queries has been imprecise and inconclusive due to the changing demands of the customers and varied producer portfolios. Moreover the current models being used to estimate the personalised relevance on these platforms have been reported to be susceptible to popularity bias and gaming by the popular producers. As a result of such flawed estimation of relevances, the platforms cause huge disparity in exposure (visibility) of the producers leaving new/small producers at huge disadvantages giving rise to unintended anti-competitive behaviours and even risking long-term sustainability of the platforms. To ensure fair chance to all the producers, we propose to ensure a minimum exposure guarantee for producers. While minimum exposure guarantee can improve the situation for producers, it might cause loss in customer utility. Thus, we propose to also ensure a minimum utility guarantee for the customers thereby making it a two-sided guarantee problem.

		-  Popularity Prediction of Hashtags 


		-  Predicting the popularity dynamics of Twitter hashtags has a broad spectrum of applications. Existing works have primarily focused on modeling the popularity of individual tweets rather than the underlying hashtags. As a result, they fail to consider several realistic factors contributing to hashtag popularity. In this paper, we propose Large Margin Point Process (LMPP), a probabilistic framework that integrates hashtag-tweet influence and hashtaghashtag competitions, the two factors which play important roles in hashtag propagation. Furthermore, while considering the hashtag competitions, LMPP looks into the variations of popularity rankings of the competing hashtags across time. Extensive experiments on seven real datasets demonstrate that LMPP outperforms existing popularity prediction approaches by a significant margin. Additionally, LMPP can accurately predict the relative rankings of competing hashtags, offering additional advantage over the state-of-the-art baselines.
